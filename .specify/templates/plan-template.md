# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Google Apps Script (JavaScript ES6+)

**Storage**: Google Drive + Google Sheets + Properties Service  
**Testing**: Apps Script Test Runner (optional)  
**Target Platform**: Google Apps Script  
**Project Type**: apps-script  
**Performance Goals**: <60s per run, within daily quotas  
**Constraints**: 6-minute execution limit, API rate limits, no heavy external deps  
**Scale/Scope**: 20-30 jobs/day

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

**Structure Decision**: Apps Script single project with `src/` and `tests/`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
